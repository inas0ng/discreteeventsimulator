# CS2030 Project: Discrete Event Simulator
Quoting from the question paper:
> A discrete event simulator is a software that simulates the changes in the state of a system across time, with each transition from one state of the system to another triggered via an event. Such a system can be used to study many complex real-world systems such as queuing to order food at a fast-food restaurant.

This is a CS2030 project completed in AY21/22 Sem 2. <br>
The question paper is in a PDF titled "Discrete Event Simulator" that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/inas0ng/discreteeventsimulator/blob/main/Discrete%20Event%20Simulator.pdf).

## How to Use
1. User input starts with five integer values representing:
   - the **number of servers**,
   - the **number of self-check counters**
   - the **maximum queue length**
   - the **number of customers**
   - the **probability of a server resting**
3. Enter the **arrival times of the customers**. 
4. Enter the **service times** for the customers.

## Example Usage
After compiling the code, enter `java Main8 << 8.1_in` to simulate an example of using the simulator at the highest level, Level 8.
